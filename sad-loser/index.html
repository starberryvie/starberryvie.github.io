</h2><p>Yoonseok / SOPE AU where Yoongi is a sad loser who can time travel. He joins the Sad Losers™ which is a group of sad losers who wants friends and Hoseok is part of it too.
</p><p><img src="media/DWzytPsUMAABKlV.jpg" /></p><p>This prolly gonna flop but I'm making it for a sad loser sope trash who likes fancy fictional themes aka me
</p><p>Sad boi is ranting to a bot on new years<br /><br />*convos with Vent will be like a journal for Yoongi to share his thoughts. It'll record everything despite the time travelling Yoongi will do.
</p><p><img src="media/DWzzuglVwAA-EeQ.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi saw Namjoon's post and got excited
</p><p><img src="media/DWz0ROQVwAUKcEq.jpg" /></p><p>^^^IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE "the sad losers" not the sad idiots I was thinking about myself when I was typing that
</p><p>It's official!
</p><p><img src="media/DWz1pgFUMAAwKlP.jpg" /></p><p>All gcs start off awkward esp if you're an antisocial ass it's an inevitable curse and yoongi's panicking.<br /><br />My edit's really bad I'm not sorry
</p><p><img src="media/DWz2_BTVMAEbXTp.jpg" /></p><p>A BOY APPROACHES!?!!!??<br />Yoongi loves Drake he's just not quick on his feet :(<br />(Hoseok's referring to Do Not Disturb by Drake)
</p><p><img src="media/DWz4oASVQAACBwP.jpg" /></p><p>You don't always have to use time travelling for cool things
</p><p><img src="media/DWz4vgLU8AEpOuk.jpg" /></p><p>A loser has a crush
</p><p><img src="media/DWz4_9WVwAE3l5U.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />The losers are getting more familiar with each other. Everyone likes marvel.
</p><p><img src="media/DW2CLgNVMAAHQA_.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />Yoongi's been trying to get closer to Hoseok but he uses time travel for any little slip ups like this dumb one
</p><p><img src="media/DW2DLhmUMAAjbHG.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />Losers being losers are debating over something that has been settled long ago but they're bonding. Yoongi's also getting used to the whole friend thing too.
</p><p><img src="media/DW2DolTUQAADDCT.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />It's a big fat crush™
</p><p><img src="media/DW2D9cwU8AAe3I3.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />It's chaotic
</p><p><img src="media/DW2Er_dVAAEH8TT.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />It's Valentines my dudes<br />They're gonna meet and watch Black Panther
</p><p><img src="media/DW2FBKiVwAA7T46.jpg" /></p><p>Meanwhile on the private chat...<br />Yoongi confessed....kinda
</p><p><img src="media/DW2FSuJUQAAhkFO.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi thought he facked up but then he got a reply :(
</p><p><img src="media/DW2Fv8DVQAAngfx.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's panicking again and called himself yoongs.<br />According to webmd he's dying of CHD
</p><p><img src="media/DW2G6CuU8AElxl8.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />The losers are out for Black Panther but Hoseok couldn't come :(
</p><p><img src="media/DW2HPZ0U0AAIqCY.jpg" /></p><p>Meanwhile on the private chat... Yoongi wanted Hoseok to come :(
</p><p><img src="media/DW2HfsoUMAAUV-0.jpg" /></p><p>The Sad Losers™ first meeting but without Hoseok.<br />@.animefreakz1997 is jungkook btw
</p><p><img src="media/DW2IEK5VAAARjM6.jpg" /></p><p>1 am 17/02/18<br />Of course Yoongi's over the moon
</p><p><img src="media/DW2JBGoVoAErsKR.jpg" /></p><p>After he calmed down, Yoongi talked about his day and Hoseok.
</p><p><img src="media/DW2JWlqV4AAZ506.jpg" /></p><p>BTW here are their @ I'm not creative enough to think of unique ones
</p><p><img src="media/DW2KGzkUMAM1N7F.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />Small moments of the Sad Losers™ bonding and oniisan is a sad loser
</p><p><img src="media/DW5iZ6LVwAEbQWf.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />uwu hours suddenly turned into talks about ideal types and then anime
</p><p><img src="media/DW5jRtAVMAIsSma.jpg" /></p><p>For the non art geeks,<br />The Great Wave Off Kanagawa (left) portrays the power and impact of a wave while Water Lilies (right) reflects the calmness of the river with water lilies.<br />Both are completely different artistic portrayals of the same element but both are so, so beautiful
</p><p><img src="media/DW5ksImUQAEHgqB.jpg" /></p><p>Hoseok still wanted to talk about ideal types and Yoongi showed a more vulnerable side to him. Then it got a bit silly.
</p><p><img src="media/DW5lY-rVMAAGqV9.jpg" /></p><p>He's really special.
</p><p><img src="media/DW5lom9VwAAgD7o.jpg" /></p><p>1:08am 07/03/18<br />The Sad Losers are going out for chocolate but Yoongi's busy and Hoseok couldn't come (again)
</p><p><img src="media/DW9bAynVwAA9r99.jpg" /></p><p>Jesus why can't Hoseok ever meet up with the rest
</p><p>Hoseok's free on the 9th !! But no one else is D:
</p><p><img src="media/DW9bdIHUQAAbFH1.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's free on the 9th !! And oh wait it's his birthday wait what
</p><p><img src="media/DW9bsxCUQAAie5B.jpg" /></p><p>Hoseok's ass is hypocritical but they're meeting up at yoongi's for a Jessica Jones marathon to celebrate both their birthdays!
</p><p><img src="media/DW9cE0CU0AEYlAg.jpg" /></p><p>2:23am 07/03/18<br />Yoongi's a bit suspicious but it didn't last long we're back to whipped-for-hoseok o'clock again
</p><p><img src="media/DW9cuY3VoAAje0I.jpg" /></p><p>Later that day
</p><p><img src="media/DW9oSWZVwAEZ1C0.jpg" /></p><p>5:48pm 09/03/18<br />Birthday boy is quaking and paranoid
</p><p><img src="media/DW-ugIFVAAAoQL-.jpg" /></p><p>Oh god he's early
</p><p><img src="media/DW-vJ8uV4AASBuc.jpg" /></p><p>Their first photo together!<br />Everyone's going nuts but who cares!
</p><p><img src="media/DW-vfNKVAAEuTJP.jpg" /></p><p>That hug Hoseok gave him just before he left is pure evil and Yoongi is turning insane but very uwu
</p><p><img src="media/DW-wEgBVQAA3G__.jpg" /></p><p>Yeah imagine not ever having someone special your whole life and then one just somehow appeared and gave you a hug. Yoongi's calm water lilies are only external while internally, he was the sheer force of the great wave off kanagawa. Showing off gifts to end the really, really nice night
</p><p><img src="media/DW-xK0bVAAAV35x.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi gave up counting how many times he travelled back to relive that evening with Hoseok again. To see him, to hear his voice, to hug him. For all he knew, Yoongi could have spent his whole life time travelling back to then.
</p><p><img src="media/DW-0a_PVAAAvinT.jpg" /></p><p>/18 - 24/03/18<br />Hair dyes and them being cute
</p><p><img src="media/DXCgtjAVQAAk2rg.jpg" /></p><p>1:34am 28/03/18<br />Yoongi's still cautious and oh wait he can time travel
</p><p><img src="media/DXChPGEU8AA_XkP.jpg" /></p><p>3:22pm 03/04/18<br />There are cats in Yoongi's apartment<br />(I forgot to change Hoseok's DP in the previous one talk about being organised)
</p><p><img src="media/DXCt9oAVAAAlrIX.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's a good person and Hoseok's just finding excuses to come over uwu
</p><p><img src="media/DXCuQKLVwAAcJaj.jpg" /></p><p>11:50pm 16/04/18<br />The losers are going out for bbq but Hoseok can't go... again?? Seriously?
</p><p><img src="media/DXC9qHgUQAA6Jhb.jpg" /></p><p>Wait what's happening
</p><p><img src="media/DXDDsK2VAAEB3Ud.jpg" /></p><p>Guys stop this
</p><p><img src="media/DXDF-vhU8AE84af.jpg" /></p><p>Thank god for Namjoon.<br />All of them may be upset for different reasons but it's because they all care for Hoseok.
</p><p><img src="media/DXDUlGsVoAALkJf.jpg" /></p><p>Hoseok tried to explain his situation with the least detail he's comfortable with sharing
</p><p><img src="media/DXDmFkmVAAAI2zC.jpg" /></p><p>Teary-eyes over their friendship and Hoseok broke it but they made up!
</p><p><img src="media/DXDmpW1U8AEsWHx.jpg" /></p><p>A little patience doesn't hurt. It's a date!
</p><p><img src="media/DXDnrFpVMAEmpT1.jpg" /></p><p>00:02am 17/04/18 (I got the date in the photo wrong sorry}<br />Yoongi was still worried so they talked then Hoseok promised to let Yoongi know about his situation
</p><p><img src="media/DXDqH2WVMAAzSvB.jpg" /></p><p>00:08am 17/04/18<br />Yoongi reflects upon his actions later alone and starts to emphatize with the others.<br />The fact that Hoseok trusts him made his head spin
</p><p><img src="media/DXDrwsjVwAA4X5Z.jpg" /></p><p>We're almost halfway through the au so please let me know what you think! I have the whole story planned already so let me know if I should continue it or not! <a href="https://curiouscat.me/hopespiration">(curiouscat.me/hopespiration)</a> Thank you so much for the love for this au! I'll be continuing it now 💕
</p><p>8:23pm 09/05/18<br />Hoseok kept his promise!<br /><br />*I though he stole it FROM some Tumblr boy
</p><p><img src="media/DXIZjbsVAAEmt9Y.jpg" /></p><p>11:33-11:47pm 17/05/18<br />Hoseok is starting to open up about issues and troubles he's going through with the rest
</p><p><img src="media/DXIcXOfVAAADrBg.jpg" /></p><p>No offense but I hate you
</p><p><img src="media/DXIcj3lVwAA8PKb.jpg" /></p><p>/18 - 14/06/18<br />Hoseok started going out with others more, especially Jimin
</p><p><img src="media/DXIgjViUMAEV9i3.jpg" /></p><p>/18<br />Oh would you look at that
</p><p><img src="media/DXIhgvwVAAEeUQF.jpg" /></p><p>1:09am 30/06/18<br />Just from a single twitter post, Yoongi's whole state just turned. This is when the rollercoaster just plummets down.
</p><p><img src="media/DXIit7DVMAAv_Bw.jpg" /></p><p>11:55pm 05/06/18<br />Yoongi became quiet in the gc and everyone's worried
</p><p><img src="media/DXIqQo-VQAApzFq.jpg" /></p><p>11:57pm 06/06/18<br />Oh Jungkook sweetie
</p><p><img src="media/DXIrLJyUQAI5KyX.jpg" /></p><p>12:04pm 06/06/18<br />Namjoon tries too<br />Earth to Min Yoongi?
</p><p><img src="media/DXIsM_gVwAAL24e.jpg" /></p><p>1:10pm 09/06/18<br />They gave it a rest and now Taehyung's on it
</p><p><img src="media/DXIs_rLVQAEy9pV.jpg" /></p><p>"Let it out to someone you trust."
</p><p><img src="media/DXItoR8VwAE-Tgh.jpg" /></p><p>Oh look a poll:<br />What should Yoongi do? PLEASE keep in mind that though Namjoon is the most intelligent, Seokjin is the oldest and wisest; Yoongi looks up to him even though the lines are blurred sometimes. Seokjin will listen and conclude from what he's told while Namjoon will pitch in his ideas based on it
</p><p>Later that day, 09/07/18 10:45pm<br />Yoongi talks to Seokjin<br />"Vent"
</p><p><img src="media/DXR14kGVAAE42JO.jpg" /></p><p>"you're not delusional, I don't think you are."<br />Yoongi doesn't know if he wants to tell Seokjin about Hoseok
</p><p><img src="media/DXR4__TUMAApZXk.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi is a gay child.<br />"I care about him, he's special"
</p><p><img src="media/DXR8AMDUMAEaJN8.jpg" /></p><p>Seokjin tries to understand Yoongi's feelings<br />"Now we can talk about this properly"
</p><p><img src="media/DXR9H2zU8AAx2A9.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's still flustered so Seokjin is encouraging him to talk by asking questions that'll prompt explanations.<br />Yoongi makes it clear that he's not mad at Jimin or Hoseok.<br />"So you got mad at yourself"
</p><p><img src="media/DXR9xSSVQAEe0et.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's still in his negative head space so Seokjin weights in his own perspective to pull him out.<br />Yoongi still needs reassurance, and so comes the line,<br />"go talk to Hoseok"
</p><p><img src="media/DXR-o5-VQAAxhJ9.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi choked<br />Seokjin sets the deal straight to him.<br />.... But does he really have to?
</p><p><img src="media/DXSB5SuVMAQTfYe.jpg" /></p><p>Oh look another poll:<br />Should Yoongi listen to Seokjin? Since polls are getting involved and the choices do affect the plot, if you want to know what would happen if you chose different options, feel free to request it or ask me! <a href="http://curiouscat.me/hopespiration">(curiouscat.me/hopespiration)</a> 11:45pm* 09/07/18<br />Oh my god he's doing it
</p><p><img src="media/DXWI84CUMAAKFMA.jpg" /></p><p>He said it.<br />He did what Seokjin told him to and set the record straight, but he's still stumbling on his words (even in text)
</p><p><img src="media/DXWLCWlVwAEAkaC.jpg" /></p><p>What made you so confident you were right?
</p><p><img src="media/DXWNCvSUMAEsWGn.jpg" /></p><p>Stay at home
</p><p><img src="media/DXWPyUGUQAAVYXF.jpg" /></p><p>He's here
</p><p><img src="media/DXWRcyVUQAAsWN8.jpg" /></p><p>So what's gonna happen? See you in an hour. 1:47am
</p><p><img src="media/DXWr4opU8AApt7X.jpg" /></p><p>"do you want to kiss me"
</p><p><img src="media/DXWtIjKVAAA9qvx.jpg" /></p><p>He would've stayed.<br />And Seokjin gets a free full course meal next month
</p><p><img src="media/DXWtsUnUQAAoWul.jpg" /></p><p>Let's rewind back a bit<br />1:08am 10/07/18<br />I want to hear you say it.
</p><p><img src="media/DXWuGfQUQAENm7M.jpg" /></p><p>A little extra before I (maybe) leave you all again<br />This was when Yoongi decided to listen to Seokjin and talk to Hoseok.<br />"Prance, my child" took away Seokjin's chance of getting free lunch.
</p><p><img src="media/DXWv5aTUQAUFyD1.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi was able to recall every single detail of that evening, how Hoseok came through the door in his pajamas, the glint in his eyes when he asked the question, or how his lip freckle moved when he speaks. He knew it better than anything he'd ever learnt his whole life.
</p><p><img src="media/DXXa5SFVoAASVrX.jpg" /></p><p>8:46am 15/07/18<br />They're just being disgustingly cute now wow
</p><p><img src="media/DXXqNCVVQAEP0Ej.jpg" /></p><p>Fellas
</p><p><img src="media/DXXqpDOU8AA6rby.jpg" /></p><p>/18 - 31/07/18<br />Going on dates and all
</p><p><img src="media/DXX094kVQAAs8kt.jpg" /></p><p>11:56pm 31/07/18<br />Yoongi's an insecure man who needs reassurance but it's hard to convince him
</p><p><img src="media/DXX8CqcVQAQEN0X.jpg" /></p><p>Oh he's gonna what
</p><p><img src="media/DXX-P5eVoAAql1S.jpg" /></p><p>12:47pm* 01/08/18<br />What did they do to Namjoon
</p><p><img src="media/DXYBkEWVQAAeBam.jpg" /></p><p>Namjoon gets to the details and no one was prepared
</p><p><img src="media/DXYDp_oUQAALDWf.jpg" /></p><p>So that's why your Ryan's crying
</p><p><img src="media/DXYG9joVwAAtLL0.jpg" /></p><p>2 losers made a bet on their fellow losers' relationship
</p><p><img src="media/DXYIVelVMAA_qJg.jpg" /></p><p>2:21pm 05/08/18<br />Guess who won the bet
</p><p><img src="media/DXYJke-UQAEzZd3.jpg" /></p><p>That's all for today! We're coming closer to the end and I'm really overwhelmed by the attention and love given to this AU hhhh thank you so much. Also pitching in my cc again bc I want love and attention, ask me anything! <a href="http://Curiouscat.me/hopespiration">(Curiouscat.me/hopespiration)</a> 1:49am 24/08/18<br />So what do you like about eachother
</p><p><img src="media/DXcB89kUQAEj0WJ.jpg" /></p><p>Hoseok's answer<br />What about Yoongi?
</p><p><img src="media/DXcDCOhVoAAbiiN.jpg" /></p><p>Well
</p><p><img src="media/DXcE0f9VMAIRQCa.jpg" /></p><p>2:02am 24/08/18<br />Hoseok is extra whipped
</p><p><img src="media/DXcLHdBU0AQlBoH.jpg" /></p><p>3:14am 24/08/18<br />Namjoon doesn't want to talk about it
</p><p><img src="media/DXcNsOcVwAAi4XV.jpg" /></p><p>8:08am 24/08/18<br />The morning after
</p><p><img src="media/DXcWNNMU8AADP10.jpg" /></p><p>1:17am 01/09/18<br />Happy September why is Jungkook sending depressing naruto memes
</p><p><img src="media/DXc_mJ8U8AAgRZY.jpg" /></p><p>1:42am 01/09/18<br />Yoongi knows some thing's up so he tries to talk to Jungkook but he's- does he really have to time travel back for this
</p><p><img src="media/DXdA61MUQAA3Lrc.jpg" /></p><p>1:42am 01/09/18<br />He got a hold of him somehow.<br />Apparently Yoongi looks like Kakashi
</p><p><img src="media/DXdJt7FVAAAL0u9.jpg" /></p><p>So Jungkook shuts himself from people at school<br />The meme was the last straw and Yoongi snapped and lays it out for him
</p><p><img src="media/DXdLdOZVwAAg2vK.jpg" /></p><p>Yoongi's not the best at this and Jungkook's feeling a little hopeless so he convinced Jungkook to share his problem with the rest.
</p><p><img src="media/DXdMOfBU0AAy5SU.jpg" /></p><p>2:22pm 01/09/18<br />The Sad losers™ assemble for Jungkook, Jimin helps out

</p><p><img src="media/DXr5RjsVQAEl-TC.jpg" /></p><p>11:54pm 31/10/18<br />October should've stayed forever,<br />I don't know what I'd do without you now
</p><p><img src="media/DXr7c9RU8AA15LW.jpg" /></p><p>Oh how they wished November never came...<br />

</p><p><img src="media/DXxYTIiU0AAkGnw.jpg" /></p><p>One more
